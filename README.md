### About the Experiment 

A ballistic pendulum is a classic physics experiment used to measure the velocity of a projectile by observing the motion of a pendulum after an inelastic collision. When a projectile embeds into the pendulum bob, the system conserves momentum during the collision and mechanical energy as it swings upward. By measuring the height of the swing, one can calculate the projectileâ€™s initial velocity using principles of momentum and energy conservation.
